# CPSC1150-Assignment10-Fixed

There were some bugs with the program that resulted in the wrong numbers being displayed when I had originally submitted this assignment. This is now the fixed version, where the correct sum is always displayed. There is a bit of a bug with the formatting of the displayed numbers in the console that I am still looking to fix.

Originally my final assignment for my CPSC 1150 course, the challenge was to take two number inputs from the user, up to 40 digits long, as Strings, then perform adddition on the two operands and display the sum using the console. The operands and the sum must be displayed in proper formatting as shown:

Example:
1021 +
 392
-----
1431


Assumptions: Program only works for positive integer numbers.

Restrictions: Cannot use the types BigDecimal/BigInteger/ double/long/int for the calculations.
